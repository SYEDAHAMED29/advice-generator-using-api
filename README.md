## Lessons Learned:

`DOMContentLoaded:`

The `DOMContentLoaded` event occurs when the browser has finished constructing the DOM for the entire page. This means all the HTML elements and their associated styles, scripts, and images have been loaded and are ready to be interacted with through JavaScript.

```javascript
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
   // This code will run when the DOM is fully loaded and ready.
   console.log("DOM is ready!");
});
```
